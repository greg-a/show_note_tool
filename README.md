# show_note_tool
I created this site to assist in making show notes for a Podcasts that require timestamps. You can listen to the episode in the webpage and, while listening, you can click on the stamp button to automatically add the current minutes:seconds to your individual note. When that individual note is complete, click on the add button to add that individual note to the body of the notes. 

Added functionality: 1) Buttons to go forward or backward 15 seconds, 2) Copy body of notes, 3) Keyboard shortcuts for all functions
